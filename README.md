This is a web app , a mobile app and a chrome extention made for the researchers . This app would provide the research papers summary in the main feed , 
where user can bookmark, faorite etc the research paper. Also the user can view the complete research paper and store it as pdf. The UI would be 
more like tinder swipe.
